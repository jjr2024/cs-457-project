Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from David Vogt with UBS.

David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst

Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So Tim, and maybe this is for Luca as well. You talked about the supply chain returning back to normal after a very difficult October, November, but we're still seeing some disruptions across tech products, whether it's enterprise or consumer-facing. How do you think about your supply chain and maybe the levels of inventory or builds that you might need as we go forward to sort of insulate your business from these sort of episodic disruptions? Have you changed your view? And if so, how does that affect ultimately margins and sort of your balance sheet and cash flow items going forward? Thanks.

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

This is Tim, David. From a supply point of view, we did see disruption from early November through most of December. And from a supply chain point of view, we're now at a point where production is what we need it to be. And so the problem is behind us.

In terms of going forward in the supply chain, we build our products everywhere. There are component parts coming from many different countries in the world, and the final assembly coming from three countries in the world on just iPhone. And so we continue to optimize it. We'll continue to optimize it over time and change it to continue to improve.

I think when you sort of zoom out and back up from it, the last three years have been a pretty difficult time between COVID and silicon shortages and the like. And I think it's -- I think we have had a very resilient supply chain in the aggregate. In terms of supply for this quarter, which I think was one of your points, I think we're in decent supply on most products for the quarter currently.

David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst

Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.

Shannon Cross -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted to dig a bit more into the commentary on gross margin. The guidance especially of 43.5% to 44.5% is obviously quite strong. So I'm wondering what's helping you out there, assume mix and some other things.

And then how should we think about what currency and hedge is going to do as we look forward? And then I have a follow-up.

Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer

Shannon, yes, I mean, we've had good margin for the December quarter to start with. We reported 43%. Obviously, in December, we have the benefit of leverage because of the seasonality of the business, but we also had favorable mix across the board. Of course, foreign exchange is an issue right now.

In the December quarter on a sequential basis, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during the last 12 months. For March, yes, we've seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to 44.5%.

We're doing a lot of work around cost, of course. Mix will continue to help, both within categories and services mix as we move away from the holiday season. But we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points sequentially, but it's mitigating.

The last couple of weeks, the dollar has weakened a bit. And so hopefully, as we go through the year, hopefully, things will improve. But for now, as you correctly state, we are in a good position on margins.

Shannon Cross -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Thank you. And then, Tim, can you talk a bit about China? What you're seeing -- obviously, you've had the issues with production, but I mean more on the demand side. As we've gotten through Chinese or in Chinese New Year and the opening, I'm just wondering, are you seeing the Chinese consumer come back? What are they buying? And how are you thinking about your position there?

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

Shannon, last quarter, we declined by 7% on a reported basis, but we actually grew on a constant currency basis. And that was despite some significant -- the supply constraints that we talked about earlier. And obviously, the sort of the COVID restrictions throughout China that happened in various different places throughout the country also impacted the demand during the quarter. When you look at the opening that started happening in December, we saw a marked change in traffic in our stores as compared to November.

And that followed through to demand as well. And I don't want to get into January. We've obviously -- for January is included in the guidance or the color rather that Luca provided earlier. But we did see a marked change from December compared to November.

Shannon Cross -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Thank you.

Our next question is from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.

Erik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Guys, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Tim, first one for you. That 2 billion installed base -- device installed base figure, that's up, I believe, 200 million units year over year. That implies the strongest annual gain in new devices in your installed base basically as far back as you've provided those data points.

And so I guess my two questions are: one, do you -- can you provide the installed base for the iPhone at year-end? And then two, is there anything that you see in this new cohort of users that might look different or similar to past cohorts, either by demographic or regions or monetization ramp? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. The installed base is now over 2 billion active devices, as you mentioned. And we set records across each geographic segment and major product category. And so it was a broad-based change.

Two, correct one thing you said, it's up over 150 million year over year. The last report we reported to be over 1.85. And so it's 150 million, which we're very proud of. We also saw strong double-digit in several of the emerging markets, which is very important to us.

For example, India and Brazil as just two examples. So very, very strong. And obviously, it bodes well for the future.

Erik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Great. Thank you for that, Tim. And then, Luca, obviously, the December quarter was negatively impacted by the production challenges. Can you just maybe unpackage where channel inventory levels are today kind of across the iPhone broadly? And then what the data that you're seeing so far this quarter is telling you about iPhone demand deferral versus kind of iPhone demand structuring and perhaps pushing some upgrades later into the year rather than into the March quarter? And that's it for me.

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Erik, I'll take that one as well. The channel inventory levels on iPhone, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range given the supply challenges on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. But as you think about this, keep in mind that a year ago, we also exited the December quarter below our target inventory range because of supply challenges in the year-ago quarter.

Not related -- not the same issue, but just as a point. And so that hopefully gives you some flavor of that. In terms of what we're seeing in January, we've included in our color that Luca provided kind of our thinking. It's very hard to estimate the recapture because you have to know exactly what would have happened and how many people bought down.

And it takes a while to get that -- to get those reports in during the quarter. And so we've made our best guess at it. In terms of the sizing of the constraint in Q1, what we estimate, although not with precision, is that we would -- I thought we believe iPhone would have grown during the quarter had it not been for the supply shortages. So hopefully, that provides you a little bit of color.

Erik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Yeah. That's great. Thanks so much.

Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance

Thanks, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?

Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question.

Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well, if I can. I guess the first kind of question, just going back on the gross margin line.

Pretty good guidance into this March quarter. I'm curious if you unpack that a little bit specific around what you're seeing as far as may be benefits from component pricing in the guidance, if you're embedding any of that at this point.

Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Of course, with our guidance, we try to capture every aspect of our cost structure. And obviously, components are a big portion of that. So definitely, that's included.

And keep in mind, again, that foreign exchange -- I mentioned earlier, I think to Shannon, that the sequential negative on FX is 50 basis points versus a year ago, it's 270 basis points. Obviously, the U.S. dollar has moved a lot over the last 12 months. So obviously, we need to find offsets and more to the negative FX in order to be able to provide this kind of guidance.

And so obviously, components are a big part of that.

Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Yep. And then kind of from a strategic perspective, given kind of the things that we're seeing out in some of your peer group, I'm curious, Tim, how you think about the role of AI in your strategy as far as particularly in the services segment, whether you're not -- you see opportunities to excel monetization abilities within the paid subscriber base and whether or not AI, is it something that you're implementing a bit more strategically there?

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

Yep. It is a major focus of ours. It's incredible in terms of how it can enrich customers' lives. And you can look no further than some of the things that we announced in the fall with crash detection and fall detection or back a ways with ECG.

I mean these things have literally save people's lives. And so we see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do. It's obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical. And so it will affect every product in every service that we have.

Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.

Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Yep. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I have is, Tim, I think based on your earlier comments that iPhones would have grown ex the production issue that implied that maybe it's a $7 billion or so impact that you had in December quarter from the production challenges on the high-end models. I'm sure it's tough to see what happens this time around.

But I think historically, when you've had production issues or things like this happen, what has the consumer behavior being typically? Do they tend to go down toward the lower-end models and get the phone they want quickly? Or do they just defer the production? Just from a historical perspective, I think do you typically recover what's deferred out or no?

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

It's very hard to estimate is the real answer because you have to know a lot of data, and it's usually only in hindsight that you have a more reasonable view of it. And so we put our best views in the color that Luca provided. That's kind of what I would say.

Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

All right. And then I guess maybe if I think about services as you go forward. I know you had really good growth in services, I think, over the last several years. But as you go forward in services, what do you think drives the growth more? So is it the expansion of your installed base? Or is it more going to be driven by ARPU going higher for you? I'm just curious, how do you think about those two buckets as you go forward?

Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer

Amit, there's a number of things, and I've mentioned a few of them during the call. The first step is always the installed base. It's the engine for services growth. And the fact that the installed base is growing very nicely, and it's growing in a lot of emerging markets, it's growing even faster, that gives us a larger addressable pool of customers.

So that's incredibly important. The second one is that we are seeing that the level of engagement of our customers already in our ecosystem continues to grow. We -- I mentioned that both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits. And so that bodes very well for the future.

And we have a lot of transacting accounts that kind of moved to paid accounts over time. The other aspect that is very important for us is to continue constantly to improve the reach and the quality of our services. And I give the example of Apple Pay, which it's a great example because we started off primarily in the United States. Now we've taken it to 70 markets, millions of merchants.

And so obviously, payment services are -- continue to set new highs all the time for us. And as we've seen over the last few years, we also launched new services over time, and that obviously contributes to the growth. We're very excited. And when we look at the behavior of our installed base, we think it's very promising for the continued growth of our Services business.

Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

OK. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler.

Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Yeah. Hey. Tim,I had a quick question on emerging markets. Seems like you're making a lot of strides in India.

Potentially wanted to understand the kind of share you have in China and India. And relative to that, what would be your aspirational but sort of achievable share in iPhones in those territories, whether it's units or revenues? And I was hoping to draw on your experience and maybe what you've seen in other countries where you've had some longer presence.

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

And looking at the business in India, we set a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year. And so we feel very good about how we performed, and that was -- that's despite the headwinds that we've talked about. Taking a step back, India is hugely exciting market for us and is a major focus. We brought the online store there in 2020.

We will soon bring Apple retail there. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on the market. There's been a lot done from a financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy. And so there's a lot going on there.

We are, in essence, taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scale to China and bringing that to bear. And I don't have the exact market shares in front of me, but I think you would see that from a market share point of view that we grew around the world last quarter despite -- on iPhone despite the challenges that we've had on the supply side. And I wouldn't expect to have a difference in those two markets.

Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Understood. And for my follow-up, I had a sort of interesting theoretical question on pricing. Assuming we get the CHIPS Act passed, and there's a whole bunch of manufacturing that happens in U.S. and other territories that are potentially somewhat more expensive than the ones you might be now, have you -- has the company done any studies to gauge the elasticity of demand relative to small price increases in your products?

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

We have experience in that, but I wouldn't necessarily draw the same conclusion that you have in terms of the cost of the product. I -- we don't know at this point exactly what that will be, but we're all in, in terms of being the largest customer for TSMC in Arizona. I'm very proud to take part in that. That's what I would say about that.

Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

OK. Fair enough. Thank you, Tim.

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.

Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Thank you. Tim, you've done a phenomenal job of driving consumer choice toward higher-end products within your portfolio. How would you compare this cycle for iPhones if you were to segment the Pro versus non-Pro models versus the cycles from the past few years? And do you think this move to higher ASPs is sustainable? Or do you think it reverses in a tighter consumer spending environment? And I have a follow-up.

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

The Pro has been a -- 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max have done extremely well up until the point where we had a supply shortage and couldn't provide them -- couldn't provide the total of the demand. And so it's definitely a strong Pro cycle. I think there's a number of reasons for that, but the most important one is always the product. And I think the innovations and the product speak for themselves.

And we feel very good about the product that we announced back in September and are happy to now be at a point where we're shipping to the demand.

Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

And Tim, do you think that this move to sort of higher ASPs that has happened over the last few years is sustainable? Or could it sustain in this very tough macro environment that you've cited?

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

I wouldn't want to predict, but I would say that the smartphone for us -- the iPhone has become so integral into people's lives. It contains their contacts and their health information and their banking information and their smart home and so many different parts of their lives, their payment vehicle and -- for many people. And so I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category.

Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

OK. Great. And Tim, you clearly emphasize the focus and importance of the installed base. If we think about the absolute grit of the installed base from 1 billion to 2 billion over 7 years from a device standpoint, how should we think about the penetration of services or the growth in paying customers on services or that time frame? Is that penetration rate increasing or decreasing? How fast is that growing relative to the growth of the overall installed base?

Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer

Wamsi, it's Luca. Yes, of course, we keep track of that. It's really important for us. Over the last seven years, as we doubled the installed base, we've seen a growing engagement of our customers on the platform.

That happens, first of all, by customers transacting on the platform and then moving to paid accounts. So starting to pay for some of the services. That percentage of paid accounts tends to grow over time. We've seen it in developed markets.

We see it in emerging markets. And that is due to some of the reasons that I was explaining earlier, including the fact that we made it easier for our customers to get engaged on the platform. For example, we offer multiple payment methods in many countries. And we've made it easier to explore for more services because we've added a lot of services on the platform over the last seven years.

So to your question, of course, higher engagement means a higher percentage of paid accounts over time.

Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

OK. Thank you.

Operator, can we move on to the next?

Operator

Richard? OK. Next we'll hear from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Jim, your line is open. If you can release your mute function, we are unable to hear you.

Jim Suva -- Citi -- Analyst

Tim and Luca, you both mentioned earlier on the Q&A a little bit about India. I was wondering if we're now entering a situation of even more opportunity because we've exited COVID. We've exited countries with different COVID criteria. We've also seen India build out its higher-speed transmissions.

And your market is -- shares tremendously underrepresented there. And it appears with the supply chain, you're looking at diversifying kind of operational risk, not specific to any country, but just overall. Now you look at potentially opening up stores and stuff. Am I right that, that's the way you look at it is it's even more prime for opportunity now than ever? And once you start opening up stores there, you could just see a complete green shoots of adoptions or any additional commentary on your view on India as now we've navigated COVID and supply chain and so many challenges over the past two years? Thank you, gentlemen.

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Jim, we actually did fairly well through COVID in India. And I'm even more bullish now on the other side of it, or hopefully, on the other side of it. And that's the reason why we're investing there.

We're bringing retail there and bringing the online store there and putting a significant amount of energy there. I'm very bullish on India.

Jim Suva -- Citi -- Analyst

Thank you. And then as my quick follow-up, you had mentioned that Services, not necessarily specific to India, but Services overall were better than expected. And of course, supply chain was more challenged than expected. So what was the bridge factor of services being better than expected on upside? Was it like advertising or apps or paid monthly subscriptions? Or what were kind of the things that really surprised you to the upside on services? Thank you.

Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer

It was -- Jim, it's Luca. It's primarily the -- this level of engagement we saw, which then reflects into the, as you said, the paid subscriptions. We saw very good results in our cloud services business in payment services. Music was very strong.

So we had a number of categories that set new records, all-time records. And they did a bit better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. And so Tim mentioned that during, I think, his prepared remarks that when you look at it in constant currency, we grew services double digits. And that was on top of a 24% increase a year ago.

So it's very sustained growth that we're seeing.

Jim Suva -- Citi -- Analyst

Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two.

The first one, Tim and Luca, you mentioned how the macro did soften, and it has an impact. And as consumers tighten their belt, we look across your hardware products and service businesses. Where are you seeing the biggest impact? And where are you seeing the least impact from the softening macro? And then I had a quick follow-up.

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

We think there were some impact across the products and in Services. Probably, the ones that we saw the most impact on were Mac and Wearables. You can see that in those numbers. And probably, the least would have been iPhone.

Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then just a quick follow-up on the Mac.

The PC industry is expecting a decline in PC shipments this year also. How do you think about the Mac relative to kind of like where the PC industry as a whole is expecting the shipments to end up? Is there any color you can give on that?

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

The industry is very challenged, as you say. It's -- the industry is contracting. I think from us, though, is -- and I don't know how this year will play out, so I don't want to predict the year. But over the long run, we have a market that is a reasonable sized market, a big market.

And we have low share, and we have a competitive advantage with Apple silicon. And so strategically, I think we're well-positioned in the market, albeit I think it will be a little rough in the short term.
