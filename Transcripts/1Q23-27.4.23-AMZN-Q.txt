Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. [Operator instructions] Thank you and please hold while we poll for questions.

Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. 

Doug Anmuth -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst

Thanks so much for taking the questions. Andy, you talked about the continued optimization. Just curious, can you talk about the degree to which optimization has been done in AWS versus what you think could still lie ahead? And when do you start to lap some of those efforts? And then also on the capex side, I think you said overall capex would be down in '23. Can you just help us understand that a little bit better between retail and AWS? And then what's required on capex from a generative AI and large language model perspective? Thanks.

Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer

This is Brian. I'll take the first -- or the second part of that question first. On capex, we spent $59 million -- $59 billion, excuse me, last year. And on our core fulfillment and transportation areas, we actually are spending less year over year, and those estimates are going down.

The GAAP or the increases in AWS and infrastructure and we are adding more dollars for large language models and generative AI. So, we're creating some space in our fulfillment and transportation number that has been repurposed over to AWS. We still think the combined capex will be lower year over year. 

Andy Jassy -- Chief Executive Officer

Just on your first question, Doug. It's hard to say exactly where we are in the process. I think that what we continue to see when we talk with customers is that they're appropriately cautious about what they're seeing in the economy. They're trying to find ways to save money as most companies are, including our own.

And we have a long track record, which we continue to pursue, which I think makes sense for customers and for our business long term that we're not trying to optimize for a quarter or for a year. We're going to do whatever it takes to help customers be successful over a long period of time because we're trying to build relationships in a business that lasts all of us. And so, we're spending a lot of time with customers, trying to help them think of smart ways, not short-term ways, but smart ways to optimize their costs and to be able to scale up and down. And again, one of the big advantages of the cloud is that if you grow quickly, you can seamlessly scale up.

But when you don't have the demand, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it, and that is not true with what you see on-premises. And so, we're trying to work hard to help customers with that. I think it's important to remember that customers are pretty explicitly telling us that this is not a cost-cutting effort where we intend on spending less money on technology or on the cloud. This is our reprioritizing what matters most to our business at this time and trying to reallocate resource so we can build new customer experience of the change what's possible.

And so, I think if you think about -- those projects, by the way, take time to build. When you're reallocating, you're reprioritizing, you're redefining what you're going to build, you got to actually go build it before you can implement it. And we're working pretty carefully and closely with customers on those initiatives. I think it's important to remember that there's still so much growth ahead of the cloud, 90-plus percent of the global IT spend is on premises.

And so, if you believe that equation is going to flip, it's mostly moving to the cloud. And I also think that there are a lot of folks that don't realize the amount of nonconsumption right now that's going to happen and be spent in the cloud with the advent of large language models and generative AI. I think so many customer experiences are going to be reinvented and invented that haven't existed before. And that's all going to be spent in my opinion, on the cloud.

And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. 

Eric Sheridan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Thanks so much for taking the questions. Andy, you've talked a lot in the shareholder letter on the last earnings call about driving greater levels of efficiencies in the company and also possibly returning some of the margin structures we saw pre-pandemic and absorbing overcapacity that built up during the pandemic. Can you give us an update on where you think you are in those broad efforts to match margins versus pre-pandemic levels and strike the right balance between profitability and driving your growth initiatives over the next couple of years? Thanks so much.

Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Eric, this is Brian. Let me start on the financial part of that question. So, I think we would describe ourselves as like along on the journey and making solid progress on recovering our cost structure and getting it back to pre-pandemic levels. Andy's talked about the efforts in operations and the regionalization of our operations.

We've obviously taken a hard look at all of our businesses that we're in over the last six to nine months and have made adjustments there. But there's still a lot ahead of us, especially on the operational side that if you look at our operating margin in North American segment, it was 1.2 % this quarter. Pre-pandemic, that number was in the 4% to 6% range broadly. So, it's a bit of a marker on how much upside, but there's a lot of moving parts in that number.

Obviously, there's the advertising, there's investments going on for future growth, and there's the core profitability and cost structure that our operations are achieving. So, making progress. We're working hard at it, but it's a longer road than bouncing back in one or two quarters.

Andy Jassy -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I would just add to that we have looked pretty hard at every single one of our businesses. And I think that while it's probably most visible, given the size of it, the improvement in the operating margin and the efficiency in our stores business, I think every business is working really hard and finding ways to be more efficient. And as Brian said, I think we're making really, really good progress on the fulfillment costs in our operations network and our stores business. But one of the things that's been interesting and frankly pretty encouraging to all of us is that as we -- over the last six to nine months, as the network fundamentally changed, remember, when you go through as much growth as we went through and you double your fulfillment center footprint and you also build a last-mile transportation network the size of UPS in a couple of years, there's a lot that you have to work on to get that as productive as you want.

And we've spent a lot of time working on that the last six to nine months. But some of the ways that you operated before, which worked through several elbows in the curve and scale when they become inefficient because the network fundamentally changes, they become inefficient in a significant way. And so, it's part of what led to the regionalization effort that I talked about, but it also caused us to really reevaluate virtually everything we do in operations over the last six to nine months. And we have found a lot more opportunities than we even thought were there before.

So, I'm pretty optimistic that we have a chance not just to recover to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of operating margin, but I think there's additional upside with some of the opportunities we've identified.

And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. 

Brian Nowak -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Great, thanks for taking my questions. I have two, Andy. The first one, you talked a lot about the long-term AI and large language model potential out of AWS. I think there's a lot of discussion about AWS' competitive positioning when it comes to these tools.

Could you just sort of walk us through two or three of the key points of differentiation that you think AWS offers and AI tools versus some of the competitors? And then the second one around Echo and Alexa. The neural networks may not be a leading edge of technology now with the rapid emergence of some of these new large language models. How do you think about the key investment priorities for Echo and Alexa going forward? And what's your view on ROIC around that division? Thanks. 

Andy Jassy -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I'll try and answer those together because they're somewhat related. I think when you think about machine learning, it's useful to remember that we have had a pretty substantial investment in machine learning for 25-plus years in Amazon. It's deeply ingrained in virtually everything we do.

It fuels our personalized e-commerce recommendations. It drives the Pick Pass and our fulfillment centers. We have it in our Go stores. We have it in our Prime Air, our drones.

It's obviously in Alexa. And then AWS, we have 25-plus machine learning services where we have the broadest machine learning functionality and customer base by a fair bit. And so, it is deeply ingrained in our heritage. I think if you look at what's happened over the last nine months or so is that these large language models and generative AI capabilities, they've been around for a while, but frankly, the models were not that compelling before about six, nine months ago.

And they have gotten so much bigger and so much better, much more quickly that it really presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience that exists and many that don't exist that weren't really that easily made possible before. And so, it's very early days in that space, but probably not surprisingly, we've been investing in building in our own large language models for several years, and we have a very large investment across the company. And the way I would break it out, Brian, is I would say that there's three macro areas in this space. If you think about maybe the bottom layer here is that all of the large language models are going to run on compute.

And the key to that compute is going to be the chip that's in that compute. And to date, I think a lot of the chips there, particularly GPUs, which are optimized for this type of workload, they're expensive and they're scarce. It's hard to find enough capacity. And so, in AWS, we've been working for several years on building customized machine learning chips, and we built a chip that's specialized for training, machine learning training, which we call Trainium; and a chip that's specialized for inference or the predictions that come from the model called Inferentia.

The reality, by the way, is that most people are spending most of their time and money on the training. But as these models graduate to production, where they're in the apps, all the spend is going to be an inference. So, they both matter a lot. And if you look at -- we just released our second versions of both Trainium and Inferentia.

And the combination of price and performance that you can get from those chips is pretty differentiated and very significant. So, we think that a lot of that machine learning training and inference will run on AWS. Then if you think about -- so you have to train the models, you have to run the inference, then you got to -- but you have to build the models. And if you look at the really significant leading large language models, they take many years to build and many billions of dollars to build.

And there will be a small number of companies that want to invest that time and money, and we'll be one of them in Amazon. But most companies don't. And so, what most companies really want and what they tell AWS is that they'd like to use one of those foundational models and then have the ability to customize it for their own proprietary data and their own needs and customer experience. And they want to do it in a way where they don't leak their unique IP to the broader generalized model.

And that's what Bedrock is, which we just announced a week ago or so. It's a managed foundational model service where people can run foundational models from Amazon, which we're exposing ourselves to, which we call Titan. Or they can run it from leading large language model providers like AI21 and Anthropic and Stability AI. And they can run those models, take the baseline, customize them for their own purposes, and then be able to run it with the same security and privacy and all the features they use for the rest of their applications in AWS.

That's very compelling for customers. And then that third layer are really the applications that are going to be built on top of those large language models. So, ChatGPT is a good example of an application that's being built. We'll build some of those applications ourselves.

So, for instance, we think one of the most compelling applications that are going to be built in generative AI have to do with making developers much more effective with coding assistance. And so, we built something called CodeWhisperer, which we just announced the general availability for, where developers can plug in a natural language, something like -- I want to build a video hosting website. And CodeWhisperer will bring up the code you need and the developer needs to employ and put that in production, which is really compelling. If you think about how much more productive a developer is going to be and what they're going to spend their time on instead of rewriting code that as median takes time, I think it's a big deal.

Now to your second question and it's related to this top layer I was just talking about, we're going to build a very -- every single one of our businesses inside Amazon are building on top of large language models to reinvent our customer experiences, and you'll see it in every single one of our businesses, stores, advertising, devices, entertain. And devices, which was your specific question, is a good example of that. I think when people often ask us about Alexa, what we often share is that if we were just building a smart speaker, it would be a much smaller investment. But we have a vision, which we have conviction about that we want to build the world's best personal assistant.

And to do that, it's difficult. It's across a lot of domains and it's a very broad surface area. However, if you think about the advent of large language models and generative AI, it makes the underlying models that much more effective such that I think it really accelerates the possibility of building the world's best personal assistant. And I think we start from a pretty good spot with Alexa because we have a couple of hundred million endpoints being used across entertainment and shopping and smart home and information and a lot of involvement from third-party ecosystem partners.

And we've had a large language model underneath it, but we're building one that's much larger and much more generalized and capable. And I think that's going to really rapidly accelerate our vision of becoming the world's best personal assistant. I think there's a significant business model underneath it.

And the next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question. 

Colin Sebastian -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst

Great, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess first off, on the international segment, I mean, not only an acceleration in our top line, but also on the margin side. If you could maybe add a little more color on initiatives and improvements there. And then secondly, on the physical stores, including the grocery strategy, maybe any be worth kind of going through any updated thoughts you have there around the strategy of optimizing stores across categories.

And if there are any changes to the footprint plans for those businesses? Thank you.

Andy Jassy -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Colin. I'll start with the international question. So, yeah, we saw an acceleration of growth on an FX-neutral basis, 9% versus 5% in Q4. I think the economy there is starting to stabilize and especially in established countries of Europe.

We're seeing consumer confidence has increased and inflation is ticking down. So, some of those are similar to North America. But that is what we probably had some upside that we weren't counting on in international in the first quarter, and that was a good strength. On the margin, the negative margin has come down.

Top line is helping there but it's also a function of some of the reductions that we're making across some of our investments. Most of those are in North America, but that you'll see kind of the improvement in operational efficiency and on the edge of some of the global programs are going to be reducing cost in international. I will remind you that, again, that international is an aggregation of established countries which are already profitable and who look a bit like North America, perhaps at an earlier stage of development and working their way to parity on profitability. We have forward-loaded Prime benefits in a lot of these countries that are ahead of the curve that we saw in North America.

So, happy there. We have a large emerging business. In the last five years, we've added more than 10 new countries. What we're seeing is if you looked back to North America long ago, it took nine years for us to reach breakeven profitability in the United States.

We see a similar curve in a lot of countries overseas. There's, in fact, additional challenges that we usually have to deal with, things like lack of payment methods, lack of the established infrastructure for -- especially for transportation and infrastructure for the internet and everything else. So, the adoption can be slower but we feel good about the businesses we're building. They carry a lot of the same traits that we have in North America.

Price selection and convenience are at the core of that, very happy with the adoption and traffic and new customer acquisition that we're seeing from Prime Video in a lot of their emerging countries as well. So, good quarter. We'll continue to work again on cost structure and growing those businesses country by country. On the grocery part, what I would say is we continue to progress there.

We have an interesting grocery business where we've been in it for a while and we have actually quite a large grocery business. It's just an unusual selection grocery business, very much like how the mass merchandisers got into grocery 25, 30 years ago, where the selection are items that are not temperature-controlled, so it's canned goods and packaged food and paper products and pet supplies and personal care and health and beauty and all sorts of consumables. And interestingly, in this current environment where consumers are being cautious about what they spend and finding ways to trade down in different product variations, consumables have stayed very, very strong. And so, we continue to be very pleased with that part of our grocery business to serve a much broader number of the grocery shopping journeys, which we seek to try to help customers with.

We have to have a bigger physical presence since most of the shopping visits are still physical stores. We've got two efforts there. We've got Whole Foods, which really pioneered the organic grocery space. And that continues to grow nicely, and we've made a number of changes in the last year of the business that have changed the profitability trajectory there and feel very good about that.

And at the same time, it is still a portion of the overall market segment. And if you really want to serve as much of grocery as we'd like to, you have to have a mass physical offering. And that's what we've been working on for a few years with the brand we've called Amazon Fresh. We wish we were further along at this point.

We've tried lots of ideas. We haven't yet found conviction around the format that we want to go expand much more broadly. We have a set of experiments and ideas and concepts that we're working on across our dozens of stores there. And we're pretty optimistic that we have something that may very well work.

And we're hopeful over this next year, we find that. But we continue to believe it's a big business for us today. It's continuing to get bigger, but we believe we have the opportunity for it to be much larger for Amazon and where we can help customers more broadly. And I think having that physical presence, we will also have the ability both to be able to serve the grocery products they come for, as well as store some other pieces and help customers across some other product lines as well.

And the next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. 

Justin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Great, thanks for taking my question. I guess, AWS, can you call out any unusual items in April or 2Q for the comp? I know you had a very good 2Q last year. And just thinking about linearity in the quarter. And then second, Andy, really appreciate the shareholder letter.

It looks like you've picked medical and Kuiper as big investment areas. Do you think those -- I mean, why those areas? And does the company ever think about breaking out all the big investments that we had more clarity on the retail margin structure? Thank you. 

Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Hi, Justin, thank you. On AWS, I think Andy did a good job of laying out the dynamics we're seeing among customers right now and where they're cutting workloads and continued strength that we see in customers hitting their contractual limits and extending them and planning for the future. So, we feel really strongly about the outlook for the business and understand the short-term work that we're doing to help customers save money. So, I would say Q2 versus Q1, there's not an obvious year-over-year comp differential.

It's just, again, understanding which customers are cutting in some areas and growing in others and helping them get on hopefully to the new initiatives that they are planning as well.

Andy Jassy -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. In terms of the calling out healthcare and Kuiper in my annual letter, I think what I was trying to do in the letter was explain how we think about investing in -- how we think about our big new investments that we make. I talked about in the letter that we look at a few things. We look at if it's successful, could it be big and move the needle for Amazon with the right ROICs? Is that experience being well served today elsewhere? Do we have some kind of differentiation? And do we have some confidence that the company in that area, if not, can we acquire it quickly? And we'd like the answers to those questions, we will invest.

Some of those investments lead to what seem like relatively straightforward investments. And I talked a little bit about category expansion and international expansion in our stores business and some of the nascent retail market segments that are large for us that we think we can have big businesses in and business-to-business, our Amazon business entity and grocery, and things like Buy with Prime, which allow our consumers to use their Prime benefit in other third-party websites beyond Amazon and also let merchants convert at a higher rate because Prime members are able to pay quickly and to get that fast, reliable shipping they get from Prime. But then there are other investments I was pointing out that sometimes don't lead to categories that people might initially guess. And AWS was a good example of that where that seemed really different for us when we started to pursue that in 2003.

And we're a pretty different company because we did so even though there were a lot of people externally and internally that thought was a little bit crazy. And so, I just chose two of them there. I could have chosen a lot more. The letter was long enough as it was, so I just chose two, but I chose two that we have conviction about.

On the healthcare side, when you think about that set of questions that we ask ourselves when we consider whether we should make big investments, healthcare is a multitrillion-dollar business that's very segmented, and it's really broken in the U.S. particularly, I think in other parts of the world, too, but particularly in the U.S. And we had what we thought were some differentiated ways that we could be successful at it. And I think when -- our customers have been asking us for years to provide a pharmacy.

If you think about that, it's not -- that's a pretty natural extension from what we do in retail, and we've launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 and I think it's off to a good start. It's continuing to grow. We have a lot to do there. But a lot of our customers who like that experience said, ""Gosh, I wish you guys would help us in the broader healthcare experience."" And if you think about trying to meaningfully change that experience, primary care is right at the center of it.

And if you look at the experience that's been the case for the last several decades, we're going to have a hard time convincing our grandkids that it used to be the case to get a primary care appointment, you had to call ahead of time, a month ahead to schedule an appointment and drive 20 minutes to the doctor and park and get into the facility and wait 20 minutes in reception. And you get into an exam room, you wait 10 minutes for the doctor to come in. The doctor talks to you for five minutes and then prescribes you medicine where you drive 20 minutes to go get the medicine. And that experience just doesn't make sense and won't be the case.

And so, we looked at -- we had some experience when we started experimenting with Amazon Care, and we couldn't believe how much people like the streamlined experience. And we ultimately decided we didn't have the right business model there. But we came across One Medical where the digital app is very compelling and you can talk to a medical practitioner by chat or by video conference, or if you have to come into a physical facility, they have clinics around the country and you can get that appointment same day or next day. In all those cities, they have relationships with health specialists, where you're plugged into.

Their ability to get reservations where you can get reservations in a day or two there. And then when you need medicine, you can have it automatically shipped to you by Amazon Pharmacy or other third-party pharmacies. It's a very, very different experience. And we think we have an opportunity to be successful in helping change that experience.

And if we're successful with primary care and with pharmacy, there are a lot of other things we can help customers with as well. So, we think that's a big opportunity. I'll just briefly say on Kuiper that it's a very large number. It's hundreds of millions of households and businesses and government entities that today have limited to no connectivity to the internet.

And if you just think about what you can't do if you don't have connectivity, we all take it for granted. But having that connectivity means you can take online education courses and get an education, or you can start or run a business or you can enjoy entertainment or you can shop for anything you can imagine. And for businesses and governments, to be able to have that coverage, to be able to operate much more seamlessly in the various environments in which you have to have a presence, it's a total game changer. And so, we think it has the chance to be a very large business.

We haven't -- we've released some information about it in some of our designs. And it's pretty exciting to us how many customers in all those different segments are excited about it. And so, I just chose those two as exemplary of some of the inventions that come out of that investment process that you might not guess but that we think can be very significant for the company. 

Dave Fildes -- Director, Investor Relations

Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."
